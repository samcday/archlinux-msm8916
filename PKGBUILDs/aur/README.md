# PKGBUILDs/aur

This directory contains a select number of PKGBUILDs that have been ripped directly from AUR. The name of the directory matches the package name in AUR.

There should ideally *not* be any changes in these packages, any changes should be submitted upstream.

The reason this exists is to poke the build system to build the packages and publish them to the msm8916 repo, and to make sure these packages don't shift under our feet. Changes in upstream AUR packages should be regularly included here.
