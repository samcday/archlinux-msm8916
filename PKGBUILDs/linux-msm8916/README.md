# linux-msm8916

This package follows Arch Linux ARM's [linux-aarch64](https://archlinuxarm.org/packages/aarch64/linux-aarch64) package. It provides the latest kernel release with the msm8916 patches applied.

It's likely much more bleeding edge than [linux-msm8916-pmos](../linux-msm8916-pmos). Here be dragons.
