# linux-msm8916-pmos

This kernel package is intended to closely match the postmarketOS [linux-postmarketos-qcom-msm8916](https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/tree/master/device/community/linux-postmarketos-qcom-msm8916) package. That is, it builds the same kernel sources with the same kernel config.

It's considered a "known good" kernel package and likely the most stable kernel build for msm8916.

Also see the [linux-msm8916](../linux-msm8916/) package.
